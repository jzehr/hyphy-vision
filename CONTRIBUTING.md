## Development workflow

After cloning HyPhy-Vision, run npm install to fetch its dependencies.

While developing, use the command `webpack -w` to update `hyphy-vision.js` and
`hyphy-vision.css` with your code changes.

When generating a new release, we follow [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/) and submit the latest releases to
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyphy-vision).
